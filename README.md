IDEA:

This project will be an online service which rents out physical copies of video games to customers for a cheap weekly fee across the United States. 

We’ll allow customers to sign onto a premium membership which will allow for great perks such as a discounted weekly fee and an increased rental limit.

Customers can pre-order a game with release day delivery for an extra charge. 

We’ll host our inventory on a user-friendly website. We won’t have every game available--but we will have the popular ones with enough copies to meet demand.

We’ll maintain a database of customers and inventory on our servers at our office in California.
There will be two warehouses, one in California, and one in New York to maintain our inventory.
